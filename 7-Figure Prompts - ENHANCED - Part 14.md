Everyone says [common advice].

But here's the truth: [Your take]

I've [proof of experience] and here's what I learned:

• [Point 1]
• [Point 2]
• [Point 3]

Instead of [common advice], do this:

1. [Your method step 1]
2. [Your method step 2]
3. [Your method step 3]

Try it and let me know how it goes."

**Example:**
"Unpopular opinion: You don't need 10K followers to make 6 figures.

Everyone says 'build your audience first.'

But here's the truth: I made $200K with 487 followers.

I've coached 100+ people to their first $10K month and here's what I learned:

• Followers ≠ Revenue
• 100 engaged followers > 10K random followers
• Direct outreach > Posting content

Instead of chasing followers, do this:

1. Identify 100 ideal clients
2. Reach out directly
3. Offer value first

Try it and let me know how it goes."
