**Date:** October 12, 2025

---

I've successfully implemented a complete client management system for ProInvoice.app, addressing all the features that were documented but missing.

---

## 📊 FEATURES BREAKDOWN

### **Client Table Columns:**

4. **Invoices** - Badge showing count
5. **Estimates** - Badge showing count
6. **Revenue** - Total revenue formatted as currency

---

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Database Integration:**
- Uses existing `clients` table in Supabase
- Respects RLS policies (users can only see their own clients)
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp on edits
- Foreign key relationships with `invoices` and `estimates` tables

### **Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface Client {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  name: string;
  company?: string | null;
  email: string;
  address?: string | null;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

interface ClientWithStats extends Client {
  invoice_count?: number;
  estimate_count?: number;
  total_revenue?: number;
}
```

### **Security:**
- All operations filtered by `user_id`
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Email validation
- Input sanitization
