Purpose: Demonstrate transformation
Formula: What changed + specific results

**BODY:**

Hey [First Name],

I wasted 2 years trying to get clients the "right way."

Cold DMs. Networking events. Posting 3x a day on Instagram.

Know what I got? Crickets. And burnout.

Then I realized my mistake: I was trying to attract EVERYONE instead of the RIGHT people.

Here's what I changed (and you can implement this today):

**Step 1:** Pick ONE specific niche
Stop saying "I help entrepreneurs." Get specific. "I help female coaches hit $20K months" is 10x more magnetic.

**Step 2:** Create ONE signature offer
Not 5 packages. ONE clear transformation with ONE clear price.

**Step 3:** Build ONE simple funnel
Free value → Email nurture → Strategy call → Close

That's it.

Within 60 days of making this shift, I signed 12 clients. Now I teach this exact system to coaches who are tired of spinning their wheels.

Reply and tell me: Which step are you implementing first?

Talk soon,
[Your Name]

P.S. Want my full Client Attraction Playbook? Grab it here [link]

**SEND:** Tuesday, 10:00 AM
**EXPECTED OPEN RATE:** 35-45%
**EXPECTED CTR:** 8-12%
