### 11. HOOK BANK BUILDER

**Enhanced Prompt:**

You are a direct response copywriter with 10+ years creating scroll-stopping ads that generate 8-figure revenue. Generate 30 high-converting ad hooks for [OFFER] targeting [AVATAR] on [CHANNEL], split evenly across curiosity, proof-led, and contrarian approaches.

**HOOK PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORK:**

**CURIOSITY HOOKS (10 hooks):**
Purpose: Stop the scroll with intrigue
Formula: Pattern interrupt + open loop
Psychology: Zeigarnik effect (incomplete tasks create tension)
When to use: Cold audiences, awareness stage
Examples:
- "The weird trick that got me from $5K to $50K months..."
- "Why successful coaches are secretly struggling..."
- "The one thing nobody tells you about scaling to 6 figures..."

**PROOF-LED HOOKS (10 hooks):**
Purpose: Lead with credibility and results
Formula: Specific result + timeframe + social proof
Psychology: Bandwagon effect + authority bias
When to use: Warm audiences, consideration stage
Examples:
- "How 312 coaches hit $20K months in 90 days..."
- "The exact system that generated $2.3M for my clients..."
- "Steal the framework that landed me 47 clients in 60 days..."

**CONTRARIAN HOOKS (10 hooks):**
Purpose: Challenge beliefs and stand out
Formula: Popular belief + "but actually" + new truth
Psychology: Cognitive dissonance + curiosity gap
When to use: Saturated markets, differentiation needed
Examples:
- "Stop posting on social media (do this instead)..."
- "Why your business coach is keeping you broke..."
- "The 'hustle harder' lie that's killing your revenue..."

**HOOK CONSTRUCTION RULES:**

1. **First 3 Words Matter Most** - Hook the hook
2. **Specificity Beats Vague** - "312 coaches" > "many people"
3. **One Clear Promise** - Don't dilute with multiple ideas
4. **Match Avatar Language** - Use their exact words
5. **Create Urgency** - Imply scarcity or timeliness
6. **Avoid Jargon** - 8th grade reading level
7. **Test Emotional Charge** - Should evoke feeling

**VISUAL PAIRING STRATEGY:**

For each hook, suggest:
- **Image type:** Photo, graphic, screenshot, video thumbnail
- **Visual focus:** What to show (person, result, process)
- **Text overlay:** Key words to emphasize
- **Color psychology:** Warm (urgency) vs. cool (trust)
- **Face or no face:** When to use human connection

**INPUTS REQUIRED:**
- [OFFER]: Your product/service with core benefit
- [AVATAR]: Specific customer segment with pain points
- [CHANNEL]: Platform (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube)

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

For each of 30 hooks provide:

2. Category (curiosity/proof/contrarian)
3. Rationale (why it works psychologically)
4. Suggested visual (specific description)
5. Target audience temperature (cold/warm/hot)
6. Estimated CTR potential (low/medium/high)
7. A/B test variant (alternative version)

**Example Output:**

Text: "I went from 2 clients to 47 in 90 days without spending a dime on ads (here's the exact system)"
Category: Proof-led
Rationale: Specific numbers create credibility, "without ads" addresses common objection, "exact system" promises replicability
Visual: Split-screen before/after of calendar (2 clients vs. full pipeline)
Temperature: Warm (for people already trying to get clients)
CTR Potential: High (8-12% expected)
A/B Variant: "How I signed 47 clients in 90 days with zero ad spend"
