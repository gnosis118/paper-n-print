# Critical Security Fixes - October 11, 2025

## üö® **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

Three critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in your Supabase database.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE 1: Public Estimate Data Exposure**

### **Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

### **Problem:**
The `estimates` table was publicly readable without proper authentication. The RLS policy "Public can view shared estimates via token" allowed SELECT access based only on `sharing_enabled=true`, but **did not verify the sharing_token**.

**This meant:**
- ‚ùå Anyone could read ALL shared estimates without knowing the token
- ‚ùå Competitors could scrape sensitive business data
- ‚ùå Client names, pricing, and project details were exposed
- ‚ùå Financial calculations and payment terms were visible

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```sql
-- INSECURE POLICY (REMOVED)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view shared estimates via token"
ON public.estimates
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (
  sharing_enabled = true  -- ‚ùå No token validation!
  AND (sharing_expires_at IS NULL OR sharing_expires_at > now())
);
```

### **Attack Scenario:**
```sql
-- Attacker could run this query and see ALL shared estimates:
SELECT * FROM public.estimates WHERE sharing_enabled = true;

-- Result: Access to all client data, pricing, and business intelligence
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Removed Insecure Policy:**
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view shared estimates via token" ON public.estimates;
```

**2. Created Secure Function with Token Validation:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_estimate_by_token(_sharing_token UUID)
RETURNS SETOF public.estimates
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT e.* 
  FROM public.estimates e
  WHERE e.sharing_token = _sharing_token  -- ‚úÖ Token must match!
    AND e.sharing_enabled = true
    AND (e.sharing_expires_at IS NULL OR e.sharing_expires_at > now());
END;
$$;
```

**3. Restricted Direct Access:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view only their own estimates" 
ON public.estimates 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (
  auth.uid() = user_id 
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**Before (INSECURE):**
```
Public User ‚Üí Direct Database Query ‚Üí All Shared Estimates ‚ùå
```

**After (SECURE):**
```
Public User ‚Üí Edge Function ‚Üí get_estimate_by_token(token) ‚Üí Specific Estimate ‚úÖ
                                      ‚Üì
                            Token Validation Required
```

### **Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Estimates can ONLY be accessed with valid sharing token
- ‚úÖ No direct public access to database
- ‚úÖ All access goes through secure function
- ‚úÖ Token must match exactly
- ‚úÖ Sharing must be enabled
- ‚úÖ Expiration is checked

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE 2: Credit System Manipulation**

### **Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

### **Problem:**
The `credit_ledger` table had an INSERT policy with condition `true`, which allowed **any authenticated user** to insert credit transactions. This could enable users to fraudulently grant themselves unlimited credits, bypassing payment requirements.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```sql
-- INSECURE POLICY (REMOVED)
CREATE POLICY "System can insert credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true); -- ‚ùå Any authenticated user can insert!
```

### **Attack Scenario:**
```sql
-- Attacker could run this query to give themselves unlimited credits:
INSERT INTO public.credit_ledger (user_id, delta, reason)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 999999, 'fraudulent_credits');

-- Result: Free access to all paid features
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Removed Insecure Policy:**
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert credit transactions" ON public.credit_ledger;
```

**2. Restricted INSERT to Service Role Only:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can insert credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
TO service_role
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**3. Explicitly Denied Authenticated Users:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit inserts" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (false); -- ‚úÖ Explicitly blocked!
```

**4. Also Restricted UPDATE and DELETE:**
```sql
-- UPDATE: Only service role
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can update credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR UPDATE 
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit updates" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (false)
WITH CHECK (false);

-- DELETE: Only service role
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can delete credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger  
FOR DELETE 
TO service_role
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit deletes" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (false);
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**Before (INSECURE):**
```
Authenticated User ‚Üí INSERT INTO credit_ledger ‚Üí Unlimited Credits ‚ùå
```

**After (SECURE):**
```
Authenticated User ‚Üí INSERT INTO credit_ledger ‚Üí PERMISSION DENIED ‚úÖ

Edge Function (Service Role) ‚Üí INSERT INTO credit_ledger ‚Üí Success ‚úÖ
```

### **Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Only Edge Functions with service role key can insert credits
- ‚úÖ Regular users CANNOT manipulate their credit balance
- ‚úÖ All credit transactions must go through authorized backend functions
- ‚úÖ UPDATE and DELETE also restricted to service role
- ‚úÖ Financial integrity maintained

## üìã **MIGRATION FILE**

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251011000000_fix_critical_security_issues.sql`

**What It Does:**
1. ‚úÖ Removes insecure public estimate access policy
2. ‚úÖ Creates secure token validation function
3. ‚úÖ Restricts estimate access to owners only
4. ‚úÖ Removes insecure credit ledger INSERT policy
5. ‚úÖ Restricts credit operations to service role only
6. ‚úÖ Explicitly denies authenticated user credit manipulation
7. ‚úÖ Logs security fix in audit trail

---

## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Review the Migration**
```bash
cat supabase/migrations/20251011000000_fix_critical_security_issues.sql
```

### **2. Test Locally (Optional)**
```bash
supabase db reset
supabase db push
```

### **3. Deploy to Production**
```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to Database ‚Üí Migrations
# 2. Upload the migration file
# 3. Run the migration
```

### **4. Verify the Fix**

**Test 1: Verify Estimates Are Protected**
```sql
-- As an authenticated user, try to access all estimates
SELECT * FROM public.estimates;
-- Should only show YOUR estimates, not all shared ones
```

**Test 2: Verify Credit Manipulation Is Blocked**
```sql
-- Try to insert credits as authenticated user
INSERT INTO public.credit_ledger (user_id, delta, reason)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 1000, 'test');
-- Should FAIL with: permission denied for table credit_ledger
```

**Test 3: Verify Secure Function Works**
```sql
-- Test the secure function with a valid token
SELECT * FROM public.get_estimate_by_token('your-valid-token-uuid');
-- Should return the estimate if token is valid
```

**Test 4: Check RLS Policies**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('estimates', 'credit_ledger')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

---

## üîç **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **Estimates Table:**
- ‚úÖ Public policy removed
- ‚úÖ Secure function created
- ‚úÖ Token validation required
- ‚úÖ Only owners can view directly
- ‚úÖ Public access through function only

### **Credit Ledger Table:**
- ‚úÖ INSERT restricted to service role
- ‚úÖ UPDATE restricted to service role
- ‚úÖ DELETE restricted to service role
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users explicitly denied
- ‚úÖ SELECT still allowed (users can view their own)

---

## üìä **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Estimates Access:**

| User Type | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Anonymous | ‚ùå All shared estimates | ‚úÖ Only with valid token via function |
| Authenticated | ‚ùå All shared estimates | ‚úÖ Only their own estimates |
| Owner | ‚úÖ Their estimates | ‚úÖ Their estimates |

### **Credit Ledger Operations:**

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SELECT | ‚úÖ Own transactions | ‚úÖ Own transactions |
| INSERT | ‚ùå Any user | ‚úÖ Service role only |
| UPDATE | ‚ùå Any user | ‚úÖ Service role only |
| DELETE | ‚ùå Any user | ‚úÖ Service role only |

---

## üéØ **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Security Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Estimate Data:** Protected from unauthorized access
- ‚úÖ **Credit System:** Protected from manipulation
- ‚úÖ **Financial Integrity:** Maintained
- ‚úÖ **Business Intelligence:** Secured
- ‚úÖ **Client Privacy:** Protected

### **Breaking Changes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge Functions:** Must use `get_estimate_by_token()` function for public access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Credit Operations:** Must use service role key (already required)

### **Required Code Updates:**

**Update Edge Function for Estimate Access:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (INSECURE)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('estimates')
  .select('*')
  .eq('sharing_enabled', true);

// AFTER (SECURE)
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_estimate_by_token', { _sharing_token: token });
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **ISSUE 3: Payment Transaction Data Access**

### **Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**

### **Problem:**
The `payments` table contains financial transaction amounts and Stripe payment intent IDs. The SELECT policy uses complex EXISTS clauses that could have edge cases. Additionally, there are **no UPDATE or DELETE policies**, which means unauthorized modifications could occur.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```sql
-- Complex SELECT policy (could have edge cases)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own payments" ON public.payments
FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.estimates e WHERE e.id = payments.estimate_id AND e.user_id = auth.uid())
  OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.invoices i WHERE i.id = payments.invoice_id AND i.user_id = auth.uid())
);

-- NO UPDATE POLICY - Default behavior could allow modifications
-- NO DELETE POLICY - Default behavior could allow deletions
```

### **Attack Scenario:**
```sql
-- Potential edge cases in complex EXISTS logic
-- Could allow viewing payments from other users in certain scenarios

-- No protection against modification:
UPDATE payments SET amount = 0.01 WHERE id = 'some-payment-id';
-- Might succeed if no explicit DENY policy

-- No protection against deletion:
DELETE FROM payments WHERE id = 'some-payment-id';
-- Might succeed if no explicit DENY policy
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Simplified SELECT Policy with Explicit NULL Checks:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view only their own payments"
ON public.payments
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  (
    estimate_id IS NOT NULL
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.estimates e
      WHERE e.id = payments.estimate_id
        AND e.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- ‚úÖ Explicit NULL check
    )
  ) OR (
    invoice_id IS NOT NULL
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.invoices i
      WHERE i.id = payments.invoice_id
        AND i.user_id = auth.uid()
        AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL  -- ‚úÖ Explicit NULL check
    )
  )
);
```

**2. Restricted INSERT to Service Role:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can insert payments"
ON public.payments
FOR INSERT
TO service_role
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user payment inserts"
ON public.payments
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (false);
```

**3. Added Explicit DENY for UPDATE:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can update payments"
ON public.payments
FOR UPDATE
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user payment updates"
ON public.payments
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (false)
WITH CHECK (false);
```

**4. Added Explicit DENY for DELETE:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can delete payments"
ON public.payments
FOR DELETE
TO service_role
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user payment deletes"
ON public.payments
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (false);
```

### **Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Simplified SELECT logic reduces edge case risks
- ‚úÖ Explicit NULL checks prevent auth bypass
- ‚úÖ Payments are immutable (no user modifications)
- ‚úÖ Only service role can create/modify/delete payments
- ‚úÖ Financial data integrity maintained
