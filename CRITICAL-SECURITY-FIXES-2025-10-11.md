# Critical Security Fixes - October 11, 2025

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

Two critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in your Supabase database.

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE 1: Public Estimate Data Exposure**

### **Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

### **Problem:**
The `estimates` table was publicly readable without proper authentication. The RLS policy "Public can view shared estimates via token" allowed SELECT access based only on `sharing_enabled=true`, but **did not verify the sharing_token**.

**This meant:**
- ❌ Anyone could read ALL shared estimates without knowing the token
- ❌ Competitors could scrape sensitive business data
- ❌ Client names, pricing, and project details were exposed
- ❌ Financial calculations and payment terms were visible

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```sql
-- INSECURE POLICY (REMOVED)
CREATE POLICY "Public can view shared estimates via token"
ON public.estimates
FOR SELECT
TO anon
USING (
  sharing_enabled = true  -- ❌ No token validation!
  AND (sharing_expires_at IS NULL OR sharing_expires_at > now())
);
```

### **Attack Scenario:**
```sql
-- Attacker could run this query and see ALL shared estimates:
SELECT * FROM public.estimates WHERE sharing_enabled = true;

-- Result: Access to all client data, pricing, and business intelligence
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Removed Insecure Policy:**
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view shared estimates via token" ON public.estimates;
```

**2. Created Secure Function with Token Validation:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_estimate_by_token(_sharing_token UUID)
RETURNS SETOF public.estimates
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT e.* 
  FROM public.estimates e
  WHERE e.sharing_token = _sharing_token  -- ✅ Token must match!
    AND e.sharing_enabled = true
    AND (e.sharing_expires_at IS NULL OR e.sharing_expires_at > now());
END;
$$;
```

**3. Restricted Direct Access:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view only their own estimates" 
ON public.estimates 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated
USING (
  auth.uid() = user_id 
  AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**Before (INSECURE):**
```
Public User → Direct Database Query → All Shared Estimates ❌
```

**After (SECURE):**
```
Public User → Edge Function → get_estimate_by_token(token) → Specific Estimate ✅
                                      ↓
                            Token Validation Required
```

### **Impact:**
- ✅ Estimates can ONLY be accessed with valid sharing token
- ✅ No direct public access to database
- ✅ All access goes through secure function
- ✅ Token must match exactly
- ✅ Sharing must be enabled
- ✅ Expiration is checked

---

## ⚠️ **ISSUE 2: Credit System Manipulation**

### **Severity:** 🔴 **CRITICAL**

### **Problem:**
The `credit_ledger` table had an INSERT policy with condition `true`, which allowed **any authenticated user** to insert credit transactions. This could enable users to fraudulently grant themselves unlimited credits, bypassing payment requirements.

### **Vulnerable Code:**
```sql
-- INSECURE POLICY (REMOVED)
CREATE POLICY "System can insert credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (true); -- ❌ Any authenticated user can insert!
```

### **Attack Scenario:**
```sql
-- Attacker could run this query to give themselves unlimited credits:
INSERT INTO public.credit_ledger (user_id, delta, reason)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 999999, 'fraudulent_credits');

-- Result: Free access to all paid features
```

### **Fix Applied:**

**1. Removed Insecure Policy:**
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "System can insert credit transactions" ON public.credit_ledger;
```

**2. Restricted INSERT to Service Role Only:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can insert credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
TO service_role
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**3. Explicitly Denied Authenticated Users:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit inserts" 
ON public.credit_ledger 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (false); -- ✅ Explicitly blocked!
```

**4. Also Restricted UPDATE and DELETE:**
```sql
-- UPDATE: Only service role
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can update credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR UPDATE 
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit updates" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (false)
WITH CHECK (false);

-- DELETE: Only service role
CREATE POLICY "Only service role can delete credit transactions" 
ON public.credit_ledger  
FOR DELETE 
TO service_role
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Deny authenticated user credit deletes" 
ON public.credit_ledger
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (false);
```

### **How It Works Now:**

**Before (INSECURE):**
```
Authenticated User → INSERT INTO credit_ledger → Unlimited Credits ❌
```

**After (SECURE):**
```
Authenticated User → INSERT INTO credit_ledger → PERMISSION DENIED ✅

Edge Function (Service Role) → INSERT INTO credit_ledger → Success ✅
```

### **Impact:**
- ✅ Only Edge Functions with service role key can insert credits
- ✅ Regular users CANNOT manipulate their credit balance
- ✅ All credit transactions must go through authorized backend functions
- ✅ UPDATE and DELETE also restricted to service role
- ✅ Financial integrity maintained

## 📋 **MIGRATION FILE**

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251011000000_fix_critical_security_issues.sql`

**What It Does:**
1. ✅ Removes insecure public estimate access policy
2. ✅ Creates secure token validation function
3. ✅ Restricts estimate access to owners only
4. ✅ Removes insecure credit ledger INSERT policy
5. ✅ Restricts credit operations to service role only
6. ✅ Explicitly denies authenticated user credit manipulation
7. ✅ Logs security fix in audit trail

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **1. Review the Migration**
```bash
cat supabase/migrations/20251011000000_fix_critical_security_issues.sql
```

### **2. Test Locally (Optional)**
```bash
supabase db reset
supabase db push
```

### **3. Deploy to Production**
```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to Database → Migrations
# 2. Upload the migration file
# 3. Run the migration
```

### **4. Verify the Fix**

**Test 1: Verify Estimates Are Protected**
```sql
-- As an authenticated user, try to access all estimates
SELECT * FROM public.estimates;
-- Should only show YOUR estimates, not all shared ones
```

**Test 2: Verify Credit Manipulation Is Blocked**
```sql
-- Try to insert credits as authenticated user
INSERT INTO public.credit_ledger (user_id, delta, reason)
VALUES (auth.uid(), 1000, 'test');
-- Should FAIL with: permission denied for table credit_ledger
```

**Test 3: Verify Secure Function Works**
```sql
-- Test the secure function with a valid token
SELECT * FROM public.get_estimate_by_token('your-valid-token-uuid');
-- Should return the estimate if token is valid
```

**Test 4: Check RLS Policies**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('estimates', 'credit_ledger')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## 📊 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Estimates Access:**

| User Type | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Anonymous | ❌ All shared estimates | ✅ Only with valid token via function |
| Authenticated | ❌ All shared estimates | ✅ Only their own estimates |
| Owner | ✅ Their estimates | ✅ Their estimates |

### **Credit Ledger Operations:**

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SELECT | ✅ Own transactions | ✅ Own transactions |
| INSERT | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |
| UPDATE | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |
| DELETE | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |

## 🎯 **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Security Improvements:**
- ✅ **Estimate Data:** Protected from unauthorized access
- ✅ **Credit System:** Protected from manipulation
- ✅ **Financial Integrity:** Maintained
- ✅ **Business Intelligence:** Secured
- ✅ **Client Privacy:** Protected

### **Breaking Changes:**
- ⚠️ **Edge Functions:** Must use `get_estimate_by_token()` function for public access
- ⚠️ **Credit Operations:** Must use service role key (already required)

### **Required Code Updates:**

**Update Edge Function for Estimate Access:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (INSECURE)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('estimates')
  .select('*')
  .eq('sharing_enabled', true);

// AFTER (SECURE)
const { data } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_estimate_by_token', { _sharing_token: token });
```
