Headline doesn't clearly state what you do

**Current State:**
Headline reads: "Transform Your Business"
Too vague—doesn't tell visitors WHAT you do or WHO it's for

**Impact:** 80% of visitors (most people)

**Estimated Lift:** +25-40% conversion

**Fix Recommendation:**
Change to: "Get Your First 10 Coaching Clients in 60 Days Without Paid Ads"
- Specific outcome (10 clients)
- Specific timeframe (60 days)
- Addresses objection (no ads needed)
- Clear who it's for (coaches)

**Implementation Effort:** 0.5 hours (just copy change)

**Priority Score:** 35 / 0.5 = 70 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**A/B Test Hypothesis:**
"A specific, outcome-focused headline will increase conversion rate by 25%+ compared to the vague current headline"

---

**FRICTION #2:**
No social proof above the fold

**Category:** Trust Friction

**Location:** Landing page, first screen

**Current State:**
Visitors see headline and CTA but no proof that this works

**Impact:** 60% of visitors (skeptics)

**Estimated Lift:** +15-25% conversion

Add results grid immediately below headline:
- "Sarah: $3K → $18K/month in 90 days"

- "Jessica: Quit her job after hitting $25K months"
Include photos and specific numbers

**Implementation Effort:** 2 hours (design + copy)

**Priority Score:** 20 / 2 = 10 (HIGH PRIORITY)

**A/B Test Hypothesis:**
"Adding social proof above the fold will increase conversion by 15%+ by building immediate trust"

---

**FRICTION #3:**
Form asks for too much information

**Category:** Commitment Friction

**Location:** Lead capture form

**Current State:**
Form asks for: Name, Email, Phone, Company, Revenue, Biggest Challenge, How did you hear about us?
7 fields = high abandonment

**Impact:** 40% of visitors (form abandoners)

**Estimated Lift:** +30-50% form completion

**Fix Recommendation:**
Reduce to 2 fields: Name + Email
- Move other questions to thank-you page survey (optional)
- Or ask progressively in email sequence
- Lower barrier = more leads

**Implementation Effort:** 1 hour (form update)

**Priority Score:** 40 / 1 = 40 (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Example Creative Critique:**

**CREATIVE #1: "Transform Your Business" Ad**

**HOOK SCORE: 2/5**
"Transform Your Business" is too vague and generic. Doesn't stop scroll because everyone says this. No curiosity gap, no specific promise, no emotional trigger.

**Improvement:** "I Signed 47 Clients in 90 Days (Here's the Exact System)"
- Specific number creates credibility
- Timeframe makes it believable
- "Exact system" creates curiosity
- Implies replicability

**CLARITY SCORE: 2/5**
Unclear WHO this is for (all businesses?) and WHAT you're offering (coaching? software? course?). Benefit is vague ("transform" could mean anything).

- Clear who: Coaches
- Clear what: Client acquisition system
- Clear benefit: 10 clients in 60 days
- Addresses objection: No ads needed

**PROOF SCORE: 1/5**
No proof provided. Just a claim with no evidence. Raises skepticism.

- Real person (Sarah)
- Specific numbers (2 → 47)
- Timeframe (90 days)
- Implies system works

**CTA SCORE: 3/5**
"Learn More" is generic and low-commitment but at least clear. No urgency, no specific benefit of clicking.
