**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

I have to share this with you.

Sarah (one of our newest members who joined yesterday) just sent me this message:

"I was so nervous to invest $5K, but after my first group call, I already have 3 discovery calls booked. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you!"

She was in the exact same position as you 48 hours ago—interested but hesitant.

Now she's already seeing results.

Here's the thing: We only have [X] spots left before we close enrollment on [DEADLINE].

I don't want you to look back in 90 days and wish you had joined when you had the chance.

Ready to write your own success story?

[Enroll Now]

Rooting for you,
[Your Name]

P.S. Still have questions? Book a quick 15-min call with me: [Calendar Link]

**CTA:** Enroll Now OR Book a call

**Metric to Track:**
- Open rate (target: 30-40%)
- Click rate (target: 10-15%)
- Call booking rate (target: 3-5%)
- Conversion rate (target: 3-5%)

**Success Threshold:** 4% conversion = good, 6%+ = excellent

**If/Then Logic:**

- If they click but don't buy → Tag for Day 3 sequence
- If no open → Try SMS on Day 3
- If they buy → Remove from sequence, send welcome

---

**DAY 3: OBJECTION HANDLING**

**Timing:** 72 hours after abandonment (24 hours after Day 2)

**Psychological Goal:** Address common objections, remove barriers

**Subject Line:** "The real reason you haven't joined yet..."

**Preview Text:** "It's not what you think (and it's totally normal)"

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Can I be real with you for a second?

I've talked to hundreds of people who were interested in [OFFER] but didn't join right away.

And 90% of the time, it comes down to one of three things:

**1. "I'm not sure if this will work for ME"**
I get it. You're in a unique situation. But here's the thing: We've worked with [X] people in [their niche/situation] and the system works because it's based on universal principles, customized to your specific market.

**2. "I don't have the time right now"**
That's exactly why you need this. Our most successful clients were the busiest—they needed a SYSTEM that worked without adding 20 hours to their week. You'll spend 8-10 hours/week and see better results than the 40 hours you're spending now.

**3. "I can't afford $5K right now"**
I hear you. But let me ask: Can you afford to stay where you are for another 6 months? Our average client lands 4 new clients at $3K each in their first 60 days. That's $12K from a $5K investment. Plus, we have payment plans.

Which one of these is holding you back?

Hit reply and let's talk it through.

Or if you're ready to go, enrollment closes in [X] days: [Enroll Now]

Here for you,
[Your Name]

P.S. Remember our guarantee: If you don't hit your goal in 90 days, we work with you free until you do. Zero risk.

**CTA:** Reply with objection OR Enroll now

**Metric to Track:**
- Open rate (target: 25-35%)
- Reply rate (target: 8-12%)
- Click rate (target: 12-18%)
- Conversion rate (target: 4-6%)

**Success Threshold:** 5% conversion = good, 7%+ = excellent

**If/Then Logic:**
- If they reply with objection → Personal response addressing it
- If they click but don't buy → Tag for Day 4 (urgency)
- If no engagement → Try different channel (SMS/DM)
- If they buy → Remove from sequence, send welcome

---

**DAY 4: URGENCY ESCALATION**

**Timing:** 96 hours after abandonment (24 hours after Day 3)

**Psychological Goal:** Create real urgency, escalate scarcity

**Subject Line:** "Only [X] spots left (closing Friday)"

**Preview Text:** "After Friday, we won't reopen until Q3..."

**Email Body:**

Hey [First Name],

This is it.

We're closing enrollment on Friday at 5pm PT.

After that, we won't reopen until September (3 months from now).

Right now, we have [X] spots left.

Here's what that means for you:

**If you join now:**
- Start getting results in the next 30 days
- Be 3 months ahead of where you'd be if you wait
- Lock in current pricing (going up 20% next cohort)

**If you wait until September:**
- You'll be 3 months behind
- You'll pay $1,000 more
- You'll miss the momentum of this cohort

I'm not trying to pressure you—I just don't want you to have regrets.

If this is something you know you need, now is the time.

[Claim Your Spot]

Only [X] left,
[Your Name]

**Success Threshold:** 8% conversion = good, 10%+ = excellent

**If/Then Logic:**

- If they click but don't buy → Tag for Day 5 (last chance)
- If no engagement → Send SMS reminder
- If they buy → Remove from sequence, send welcome

**DAY 5: LAST CHANCE**

**Timing:** 120 hours after abandonment (24 hours before deadline)

**Psychological Goal:** Final push, regret avoidance

**Subject Line:** "Last call: Doors close in 24 hours"

**Preview Text:** "This is your final chance to join..."

**Email Body:**

[First Name],

This is my last email about [OFFER].

In 24 hours, enrollment closes and we won't reopen for 3 months.

I've sent you a few emails this week because I genuinely believe this could change your business.

But I can't make the decision for you.

So here's my final question:

**Where do you want to be 90 days from now?**

**Option 1:** Still struggling with [pain point], wishing you had joined when you had the chance.

**Option 2:** Celebrating your first $20K month, with a system that consistently brings you clients.

The choice is yours.

If you're ready for Option 2, this is your moment: [Enroll Now]

If not, I totally understand. I wish you all the best.

Either way, I'm rooting for you.
