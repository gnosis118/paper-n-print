## 3. CUSTOMER CREATION ✅

### Automatic Customer Creation
When user signs up:
1. `create-stripe-customer` function triggered
2. Checks if Stripe customer exists by email
3. If not, creates new Stripe customer with metadata
4. Saves `stripe_customer_id` to `user_subscriptions` table

### Customer Metadata
```json
{
  "supabase_user_id": "user-uuid",
  "business_name": "user's business name"
}
```

---

## 4. SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT ✅

### Database Schema
- `user_subscriptions` table stores:
  - `stripe_subscription_id`
  - `stripe_customer_id`
  - `plan` (always "paid" for paying customers)
  - `status` (active, past_due, canceled)
  - `credits_per_month` (2, 6, or 15 based on tier)
  - `current_period_start` / `current_period_end`

### Credit System
- Lite: 2 credits/month
- Pro: 6 credits/month
- Agency: 15 credits/month
- Credits granted on `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- Idempotency check prevents duplicate credits

### Customer Portal ✅
- Users can manage subscriptions via Stripe portal
- Endpoint: `/functions/v1/customer-portal`
- Returns portal URL for subscription management
- Users can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel

---

## 5. PAYMENT PROCESSING ✅

### Invoice Payments
- Users generate payment links for invoices
- `create-payment` function creates checkout session
- Stripe processes payment
- Webhook updates invoice status

### Estimate Deposits
- Users generate deposit links for estimates
- `estimate-checkout` function creates payment session
- Supports card and US bank account payments
- Webhook processes deposit payment

---

## 6. SECURITY MEASURES ✅
