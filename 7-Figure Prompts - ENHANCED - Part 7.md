**Stage 7: FOLLOW-UP (Post-call)**

**TURNING POINT IDENTIFICATION:**

**Positive Turning Points (Deal Won):**

- "Aha moment" - they see the problem clearly
- They ask about pricing (buying signal)
- They mention timeline (urgency)
- They ask "what's next?" (ready to move)

**Negative Turning Points (Deal Lost):**
- You talk more than listen (70/30 rule broken)
- You pitch before understanding pain
- You don't quantify the cost of inaction
- You accept objections without reframing
- You don't ask for the sale

**MISSED OPPORTUNITY PATTERNS:**

**1. Didn't Go Deep Enough:**
- Surface-level pain exploration
- Didn't quantify impact
- Missed emotional drivers

**2. Talked Too Much:**

- Interrupted prospect
- Dominated conversation

**3. Weak Objection Handling:**
- Accepted "I need to think about it"
- Didn't isolate the real objection
- Got defensive
- Didn't use feel-felt-found

**4. No Clear Close:**
- Didn't ask for the sale
- Left next steps vague
- No deadline created
- Gave them an easy out

**5. Poor Discovery:**
- Didn't qualify budget
- Didn't understand timeline
- Missed decision-making process
- Didn't identify all stakeholders

**IMPROVEMENT DIRECTIVE FORMAT:**

2. **Why It Matters** (impact)
3. **What To Do Instead** (specific action)
4. **How To Practice** (skill-building)

2. Outcome (closed/follow-up/lost)
3. Overall grade (A-F)
4. Key strengths (2-3)

**5 IMPROVEMENT DIRECTIVES:**
Each with full structure above

**EXAMPLE SALES CALL DEBRIEF:**

**CALL OVERVIEW:**

**Duration:** 47 minutes
**Outcome:** Lost - Prospect said "I need to think about it"
**Overall Grade:** C-

**Key Strengths:**
- Good rapport building in first 5 minutes
- Asked some solid discovery questions
- Clearly explained the offer

**Critical Weaknesses:**
- Pitched too early (minute 12, should wait until 25+)
- Didn't quantify cost of inaction
- Accepted "I need to think about it" without probing
- Never asked for the sale directly

---

**TURNING POINTS:**

**TURNING POINT #1 (Minute 8 - POSITIVE):**
Prospect said: "I'm so tired of the revenue rollercoaster. One month I make $15K, next month $3K. I can't plan anything."

**Why This Mattered:**
This was a vulnerable admission and a clear pain point. This was your moment to go DEEP.

**What You Did:**
You said "Yeah, that's tough" and moved on to the next question.

**What You Should Have Done:**
"Tell me more about that. How long has this been going on? What's the impact on your life? Your family? Your stress level? If nothing changes, where will you be in 6 months?"

**Impact:**
You missed the chance to make the pain REAL and create urgency.

---

**TURNING POINT #2 (Minute 12 - NEGATIVE):**
You started pitching your program.

**Why This Mattered:**
You pitched WAY too early. You hadn't built enough pain or desire yet.

**What You Did:**
"So let me tell you about my program. We have weekly group calls, a private community, and..."

**What You Should Have Done:**
Continue discovery for another 10-15 minutes. Quantify the pain. "So you said you're making $3K-$15K per month. What's that costing you? In lost income? In stress? In opportunities you can't take? If we could get you to consistent $20K months, what would that mean for you?"

**Impact:**
They weren't ready to hear your solution yet. You lost them.

---

**TURNING POINT #3 (Minute 43 - NEGATIVE):**
They said "I need to think about it" and you said "Okay, no problem."

**Why This Mattered:**
"I need to think about it" is NEVER the real objection. You needed to probe.

**What You Did:**
You accepted it and scheduled a follow-up for next week.

**What You Should Have Done:**
"I totally understand. Let me ask - if you were to think about it and decide this isn't right for you, what would be the reason? Is it the price? The time commitment? Something else?"

Then address the REAL objection.

**Impact:**
You'll never hear from them again. They're gone.

---

**MISSED OPPORTUNITIES:**

**MISSED OPPORTUNITY #1:**
You never quantified the cost of inaction.

**What You Could Have Done:**
"So you're making $3K-$15K per month, averaging maybe $9K. If we could get you to consistent $20K months, that's an extra $11K per month, or $132K per year. Over 3 years, that's almost $400K. What would that kind of money mean for you and your family?"

**Why It Matters:**
People don't buy because of what they GET. They buy because of what it COSTS them not to.

---

**MISSED OPPORTUNITY #2:**
You never asked about their timeline.

**What You Could Have Done:**
"When do you need to solve this by? What happens if you're still in the same place 6 months from now? A year from now?"

**Why It Matters:**
No timeline = no urgency = no sale.

---

**MISSED OPPORTUNITY #3:**
You never directly asked for the sale.

**What You Could Have Done:**
"Based on everything we've talked about, it sounds like this is exactly what you need. Are you ready to get started today?"

**Why It Matters:**
If you don't ask, the answer is always no.

---

**5 IMPROVEMENT DIRECTIVES:**

**DIRECTIVE #1: MASTER THE 70/30 RULE**

**What Happened:**
You talked for 60% of the call. You should be listening 70% of the time.

**Why It Matters:**
The more they talk, the more they sell themselves. The more you talk, the more you sound like a salesperson.

**What To Do Instead:**
Ask open-ended questions and then SHUT UP. Let silence work for you. Count to 5 before responding.

**How To Practice:**
Record your next 5 calls. Calculate your talk time vs. their talk time. Aim for 30/70.

**Expected Outcome:**
Your close rate will increase by 20-30% just by listening more.

---

**DIRECTIVE #2: DON'T PITCH UNTIL MINUTE 25+**

**What Happened:**
You pitched at minute 12. Way too early.

**Why It Matters:**
They weren't ready. They didn't feel enough pain yet. They didn't desire change enough.

**What To Do Instead:**
Spend 20-25 minutes in discovery. Make the pain REAL. Quantify the cost. Create urgency. THEN pitch.

**How To Practice:**
Set a timer for 25 minutes. Don't mention your offer until it goes off.

**Expected Outcome:**
When you finally pitch, they'll be READY to hear it. Close rate will double.

---

**DIRECTIVE #3: QUANTIFY EVERYTHING**

**What Happened:**
You talked about pain but never put numbers on it.

**Why It Matters:**
"Revenue rollercoaster" is abstract. "$132K per year in lost income" is REAL.

**What To Do Instead:**
Every pain point needs a number. "How much is that costing you? In dollars? In time? In stress?"

**How To Practice:**
Create a "Cost of Inaction Calculator" for your offer. Use it on every call.

**Expected Outcome:**
When the cost of NOT buying is $132K and your offer is $5K, the decision is obvious.

---

**DIRECTIVE #4: NEVER ACCEPT "I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT"**

**What Happened:**
They said they needed to think about it and you let them go.

**Why It Matters:**
That's not the real objection. It's a smokescreen. The real objection is price, trust, or fit.

**What To Do Instead:**
"I totally understand. Let me ask - what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment? The time commitment? Whether this will work for you?"

Then address the REAL objection.

**How To Practice:**
Role-play with a colleague. Have them give you every objection. Practice your responses.

**Expected Outcome:**
You'll close 50% of the "I need to think about it" people instead of 0%.

---

**DIRECTIVE #5: ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SALE**

**What Happened:**
You never directly asked them to buy.

**Why It Matters:**
If you don't ask, they won't buy. It's that simple.

**What To Do Instead:**
After handling objections, ask: "Based on everything we've discussed, are you ready to get started today?"

Then SHUT UP. First person to talk loses.

**How To Practice:**
Write out your closing question. Memorize it. Say it on EVERY call.

**Expected Outcome:**
Your close rate will increase by 40%+ just by asking.
