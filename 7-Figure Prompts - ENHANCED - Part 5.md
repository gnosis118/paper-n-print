### 16. OBJECTION JUDO

**Enhanced Prompt:**

You are a sales psychology expert who has analyzed 10,000+ sales calls and identified every objection pattern. List the 12 most likely objections for [AVATAR] buying [OFFER], score each by severity (1-5), provide 2-sentence rebuttals that reframe the objection as a benefit, and suggest micro-proof assets to overcome each.

**OBJECTION PSYCHOLOGY FRAMEWORK:**

**The 4 Core Objections (All others are variations):**

1. **TIME** - "I don't have time for this"
2. **MONEY** - "I can't afford this"
3. **TRUST** - "I don't believe this will work"
4. **FIT** - "This won't work for me/my situation"

**Objection Severity Scoring:**

**5/5 - Deal Killer:**
- Stops 80%+ of prospects
- Requires strong proof to overcome
- Must address proactively
- Example: "I've tried 3 coaches before and none worked"

**4/5 - Major Barrier:**
- Stops 50-80% of prospects
- Needs solid rebuttal
- Should address in marketing
- Example: "I don't have $5K right now"

**3/5 - Common Hesitation:**
- Stops 30-50% of prospects
- Easy to overcome with proof
- Address in FAQ
- Example: "How long until I see results?"

**2/5 - Minor Concern:**
- Stops 10-30% of prospects
- Quick reassurance needed
- Address in testimonials
- Example: "What if I need to cancel?"

**1/5 - Rare Edge Case:**
- Stops <10% of prospects
- Simple answer suffices
- Don't over-optimize for this
- Example: "Do you work with people in Australia?"

**OBJECTION REFRAMING TECHNIQUE:**

**Formula: Feel → Felt → Found**

"I understand how you FEEL. Many of my best clients FELT the same way. Here's what they FOUND..."

**Reframe Structure:**
1. Acknowledge the concern (validate)
2. Reframe as opportunity (flip)
3. Provide proof (evidence)

**Example:**
Objection: "I don't have time for this"
Reframe: "That's exactly why you need this. My most successful clients were the busiest—they needed a system that worked WITHOUT adding more to their plate. Our clients spend 3 hours/week and see better results than when they were hustling 40 hours."

**MICRO-PROOF ASSETS:**

**What They Are:**
- Small, specific pieces of evidence
- Easy to consume (screenshot, quote, stat)
- Addresses ONE objection
- Shareable and believable

**Types of Micro-Proof:**

**1. Testimonial Screenshot:**

**3. Process Screenshot:**

**5. Comparison Chart:**

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE:**

For each of 12 objections provide:

1. **Objection** (in customer's exact words)
2. **Category** (Time/Money/Trust/Fit)
3. **Severity Score** (1-5 with explanation)
4. **Frequency** (% of prospects who raise this)
5. **Rebuttal** (2-sentence reframe)
6. **Micro-Proof Asset** (specific suggestion)
7. **When to Address** (Proactive in marketing vs. Reactive on calls)
8. **Script Example** (word-for-word response)

**Example Objection Analysis:**

**OBJECTION #1:**
"I've tried coaching before and it didn't work"

**Category:** Trust (past failure)

**Severity:** 5/5 (Deal killer)
This stops 75% of prospects who've had bad experiences. Must address proactively.

**Frequency:** 60% of qualified prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I hear you—most coaching is just cheerleading with no real system. That's why we focus on implementation, not inspiration. You get a proven playbook, weekly accountability, and we don't stop until you hit your goal."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Screenshot of testimonial: "I wasted $15K on 3 coaches before this. Finally, someone who actually helps you DO the work instead of just talking about it. - Sarah M."

**When to Address:** 
Proactive - Include in sales page FAQ and email sequence

**Script Example:**
"I totally get it. You know what? 80% of my clients tried other coaches first. The difference here is we don't just give you a pep talk and send you on your way. We give you the exact system, we implement it WITH you on our calls, and we have weekly check-ins to make sure you're actually doing it. Plus, our guarantee means if you don't hit [GOAL] in 90 days, we work with you free until you do. So the only way this doesn't work is if you don't show up. Fair?"

---

**OBJECTION #2:**
"I don't have $5,000 right now"

**Category:** Money (affordability)

**Severity:** 4/5 (Major barrier)
Stops 65% of interested prospects. Needs strong ROI reframe.

**Frequency:** 70% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I understand. Here's how to think about it: My average client lands 4 new clients at $3K each in their first 60 days. That's $12K from a $5K investment. The real question is, can you afford NOT to invest in a system that pays for itself 2-3x over?"

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
ROI calculator showing: "$5K investment → 4 clients @ $3K = $12K revenue in 60 days = $7K profit + ongoing clients"

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls after establishing value

**Script Example:**
"Let me ask you this: If you keep doing what you're doing now, where will you be in 6 months? Probably the same place, right? Now, what if in 6 months you had a consistent $20K/month business? Would $5K today be worth it? Here's the thing—my clients typically land their first 3-4 clients within 60 days. At $3K per client, you've already made your investment back AND you have the system forever. We also have payment plans if that helps. What feels right for you?"

---

**OBJECTION #3:**
"I'm just starting out, I don't have testimonials yet"

**Category:** Fit (situation-specific)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 40% of newer entrepreneurs. Easy to overcome.

**Frequency:** 45% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"Perfect—that's exactly who this is designed for. 70% of my clients started with zero testimonials. We teach you how to get your first 10 clients using our 'Results First' method that doesn't require any social proof."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Case study: "How Mike got 7 clients in 45 days with zero testimonials (the exact outreach templates he used)"

**When to Address:**
Proactive - Include in marketing for beginners

**Script Example:**
"Actually, that's the best time to join. We have a specific module called 'First 10 Clients' that shows you exactly how to land clients when you're starting from scratch. We teach you the 'Results First' offer where you deliver results BEFORE asking for testimonials. Mike did this and had 7 clients in 45 days—all before he had a single testimonial. Would you like to see the exact templates he used?"

---

**OBJECTION #4:**
"How is this different from [competitor/course I bought]?"

**Category:** Trust (differentiation)

**Severity:** 4/5 (Major barrier)
Stops 55% who've bought similar products. Needs clear differentiation.

**Frequency:** 50% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"Great question. Most programs give you information—videos to watch, PDFs to read. We give you implementation. You get live coaching twice a week, we review your actual work, and you have daily access to me in our private Slack. It's the difference between a course and a coach."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Comparison chart: "Typical Course vs. Our Program" showing support level, implementation focus, accountability, guarantee

**When to Address:**
Proactive - Create comparison page on website

**Script Example:**
"I'm glad you asked because this is important. Here's the difference: [Competitor] gives you the information—great content, but then you're on your own to figure it out. We give you the information PLUS we implement it with you. Twice a week, we're on live calls reviewing your actual client outreach, your offer positioning, your sales calls. You're not alone trying to figure it out. Does that make sense?"

---

**OBJECTION #5:**
"I need to think about it / talk to my spouse"

**Category:** Trust (stalling)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 50% but often means other objection. Needs probing.

**Frequency:** 60% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. Let me ask—if your spouse said yes, is there anything else holding you back? I want to make sure we've addressed all your concerns so you can have a productive conversation."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
"How to Talk to Your Spouse About Investing in Your Business" guide with ROI calculator

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls, probe for real objection

**Script Example:**
"Of course, I totally respect that. Let me ask you this—when you talk to your spouse, what do you think their main concern will be? [Listen] Okay, so it sounds like it's really about [real objection]. Let's address that now so you can have a confident conversation. Fair?"

---

**OBJECTION #6:**
"What if it doesn't work for my niche/industry?"

**Category:** Fit (niche-specific)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 35% in specialized niches. Needs niche proof.

**Frequency:** 40% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I've worked with 47 different niches—from health coaches to business consultants to real estate agents. The client acquisition principles are the same; we just customize the messaging. In fact, I have 3 clients in [their niche] who are crushing it."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Niche-specific case study or testimonial from someone in their industry

**When to Address:**
Proactive - Create niche-specific landing pages

**Script Example:**
"Great question. The system works across every niche because we're teaching universal principles of client attraction—positioning, authority building, outreach, conversion. We just customize it for your specific market. Actually, I have 3 clients in [their niche] right now. Would you like to see their results?"

---

**OBJECTION #7:**
"I don't have an audience/email list yet"

**Category:** Fit (starting point)

**Severity:** 2/5 (Minor concern)
Stops 25% of beginners. Easy to overcome.

**Frequency:** 30% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"Perfect—you don't need one. 80% of my clients started with zero followers and zero email list. We teach you how to get clients through direct outreach and referrals first, then build your audience with the revenue you generate."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Case study: "How Jessica got to $15K months with 200 Instagram followers"

**When to Address:**
Proactive - Address in beginner-focused content

**Script Example:**
"Actually, that's ideal because you won't have any bad habits to unlearn. We teach you how to get your first 10 clients through strategic outreach—no audience needed. Then, once you have revenue and testimonials, we help you build your audience. Jessica started with 200 followers and hit $15K months in 90 days. Sound good?"

---

**OBJECTION #8:**
"How much time does this take per week?"

**Category:** Time (commitment)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 40% of busy people. Needs specific answer.

**Frequency:** 55% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"Great question. The live calls are 90 minutes twice a week. Implementation is about 5-7 hours per week—mostly client outreach and discovery calls. So about 8-10 hours total. My busiest clients batch this into 2-hour blocks and still see amazing results."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Weekly schedule template showing exactly when/how to block time

**When to Address:**
Proactive - Include in FAQ

**Script Example:**
"I'm glad you asked because I don't want to waste your time. Here's the reality: You'll spend about 8-10 hours per week—2 hours on our calls, and 6-8 hours implementing. Now, compare that to how much time you're currently spending trying to figure this out on your own. Most of my clients were spending 20-30 hours a week spinning their wheels. This gives you a clear roadmap so those 8-10 hours actually produce results. Make sense?"

---

**OBJECTION #9:**
"What if I can't make the live call times?"

**Category:** Fit (logistics)

**Severity:** 2/5 (Minor concern)
Stops 20% with scheduling conflicts. Easy to solve.

**Frequency:** 25% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"All calls are recorded and posted within 2 hours. Plus, you can submit questions in advance and we'll answer them on the call. You also have daily access to our private community for quick questions. You won't miss anything."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Screenshot of member portal showing recordings, timestamps, searchable archive

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls when raised

**Script Example:**
"No problem at all. Every call is recorded and uploaded within 2 hours with timestamps so you can jump to the parts relevant to you. You can also submit questions ahead of time and I'll answer them live. Plus, you have our private Slack for daily questions. Some of my best clients have never made a live call. Does that work for you?"

---

**OBJECTION #10:**
"I'm worried I won't follow through"

**Category:** Trust (self-doubt)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 35% with past failure. Needs accountability proof.

**Frequency:** 40% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I love that you're self-aware. That's exactly why we built in weekly accountability check-ins and a private community. You're not doing this alone. We'll keep you on track, and our 90-day guarantee means we don't stop until you succeed."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Testimonial: "I'm the queen of buying courses and not finishing them. This was different—the accountability kept me going and I actually got results. - Amanda K."

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls, reframe as strength

**Script Example:**
"You know what? The fact that you're aware of this tells me you're going to succeed. Here's why: We have weekly check-ins where you report your progress. We have a community where everyone is working on the same thing. And we have a 90-day guarantee—if you show up and do the work but don't hit your goal, we keep working with you free. So the accountability is built in. You're not white-knuckling this alone. Sound good?"

---

**OBJECTION #11:**
"Can I just buy the course without the coaching?"

**Category:** Money (cheaper alternative)

**Severity:** 3/5 (Common hesitation)
Stops 30% looking for cheaper option. Needs value reframe.

**Frequency:** 35% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I used to offer that, but 90% of people never finished it. The coaching is what makes this work—you get personalized feedback, accountability, and we troubleshoot your specific situation. The course alone is just information; the coaching is transformation."

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Stat graphic: "Course-only completion rate: 8% | Coaching completion rate: 94%"

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls, reframe value

**Script Example:**
"I totally get wanting to save money. Here's the thing: I used to sell the course alone for $997. Know what happened? 8% of people finished it. The other 92% got stuck and never got results. That's why I only offer it with coaching now—because I actually want you to succeed. The course gives you the 'what,' but the coaching gives you the 'how' for YOUR specific situation. Make sense?"

---

**OBJECTION #12:**
"I'll join next month when I have more time/money"

**Category:** Time + Money (procrastination)

**Severity:** 4/5 (Major barrier)
Stops 60% who are interested but not urgent. Needs urgency.

**Frequency:** 65% of prospects

**Rebuttal:**
"I understand. Let me ask—will next month really be less busy? Or will there be a new reason to wait? The clients who succeed are the ones who start before they're ready. Plus, we're closing enrollment Friday and won't reopen until Q3. Can you afford to wait 3 more months?"

**Micro-Proof Asset:**
Testimonial: "I almost waited until 'the right time.' So glad I didn't—I made my investment back in 30 days and now I'm 3 months ahead of where I would have been. - Tom R."

**When to Address:**
Reactive - On sales calls, create urgency

**Script Example:**
"I hear you. Let me be real with you: Next month, there will be another reason to wait. There's never a perfect time. The question is, where do you want to be 90 days from now? If you wait until next month, you're already a month behind. Plus, we're closing enrollment Friday and not reopening until September. That's 3 months of staying stuck. My most successful clients are the ones who started before they felt ready. What do you think?"
