# Security Fixes Summary - October 11, 2025

## 🚨 **3 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FIXED**

---

## 📋 **QUICK OVERVIEW**

| Issue | Severity | Table | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| Estimate Data Exposure | 🔴 CRITICAL | estimates | ✅ FIXED |
| Credit Manipulation | 🔴 CRITICAL | credit_ledger | ✅ FIXED |
| Payment Data Access | 🔴 CRITICAL | payments | ✅ FIXED |

---

## 🔍 **ISSUE DETAILS**

### **1. Estimate Data Exposure (EXPOSED_SENSITIVE_DATA)**

**What Was Wrong:**
- Public policy allowed anyone to read ALL shared estimates
- No token validation required
- Client data, pricing, and business intelligence exposed

**What Could Happen:**
- Competitors scrape your pricing models
- Client information leaked
- Business strategies exposed

**How We Fixed It:**
- ✅ Removed public access policy
- ✅ Created secure token validation function
- ✅ Token must match exactly to access estimate
- ✅ Only owners can view directly

---

### **2. Credit Manipulation (MISSING_RLS_PROTECTION)**

**What Was Wrong:**
- Any authenticated user could INSERT credits
- Policy had `WITH CHECK (true)` - no restrictions
- Users could grant themselves unlimited credits

**What Could Happen:**
- Free access to all paid features
- Bypass payment requirements
- Financial loss

**How We Fixed It:**
- ✅ Restricted INSERT to service role only
- ✅ Explicitly denied authenticated users
- ✅ Also restricted UPDATE and DELETE
- ✅ Only backend can modify credits

---

### **3. Payment Data Access (MISSING_RLS_PROTECTION)**

**What Was Wrong:**
- Complex SELECT logic with potential edge cases
- No UPDATE policy (could allow modifications)
- No DELETE policy (could allow deletions)
- Financial data at risk

**What Could Happen:**
- Users modify payment amounts
- Payment records deleted
- Financial integrity compromised

**How We Fixed It:**
- ✅ Simplified SELECT with explicit NULL checks
- ✅ Added explicit DENY for UPDATE
- ✅ Added explicit DENY for DELETE
- ✅ Only service role can modify payments

## 📊 **BEFORE vs AFTER**

### **Estimates Table**

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Public SELECT | ❌ All shared estimates | ✅ Token required via function |
| User SELECT | ❌ All shared estimates | ✅ Own estimates only |
| Owner SELECT | ✅ Own estimates | ✅ Own estimates |

### **Credit Ledger Table**

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| SELECT | ✅ Own transactions | ✅ Own transactions |
| INSERT | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |
| UPDATE | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |
| DELETE | ❌ Any user | ✅ Service role only |

### **Payments Table**

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| SELECT | ⚠️ Complex logic | ✅ Simplified + NULL checks |
| INSERT | ⚠️ No explicit policy | ✅ Service role only |
| UPDATE | ❌ No policy | ✅ Service role only |
| DELETE | ❌ No policy | ✅ Service role only |
