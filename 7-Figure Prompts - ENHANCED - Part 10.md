3. [Action item 3]

**EXAMPLE VALIDATION:**

**Niche:** Executive coaches helping burnt-out corporate leaders transition to consulting
**Offer:** 90-day coaching program ($7,500)

**FACTOR SCORES:**

**1. Search Volume: 8/10**
- Monthly searches: 45,000 for "executive coaching", 12,000 for "career transition coach"
- Trend: Rising 15% YoY (Google Trends)
- Evidence: Ahrefs shows 67K total related searches
- Notes: Strong demand, growing market

**2. Competition Intensity: 6/10**
- Competitor count: 200+ executive coaches in US
- Market leaders: BetterUp, Coach.me, individual practitioners
- Gaps identified: Few focus specifically on corporate-to-consulting transition
- Notes: Crowded but can differentiate with specific positioning

**3. Willingness to Pay: 9/10**
- Price range: $5K - $25K for executive coaching

- Notes: High-income audience, strong ROI potential

**4. Growth Trajectory: 8/10**
- Trend direction: Up
- Growth rate: 25% YoY (ICF Global Coaching Study)
- Future outlook: Remote work accelerating career transitions

**5. Audience Accessibility: 7/10**
- Primary channels: LinkedIn (highly active), executive forums, industry conferences
- Targeting difficulty: Medium (can target by job title, company size)
- Community size: 500K+ executives on LinkedIn
- Notes: Professional audience, easy to reach but competitive

**TOTAL SCORE: 38/50**

**RECOMMENDATION: CONDITIONAL GO** ⚠️

**REASONING:**
This is a solid market opportunity with strong fundamentals. The demand is real (8/10 search volume), the audience can pay (9/10 willingness), and the market is growing (8/10 trajectory). The main challenges are competition (6/10) and audience accessibility (7/10).

The key to success will be differentiation. The "corporate-to-consulting transition" angle is specific enough to stand out from generic executive coaches, but you'll need strong positioning and a clear unique mechanism.

**STRENGTHS:**
- High-income target audience
- Growing market demand
- Strong price point potential
- Clear pain point (burnout)

**WEAKNESSES:**
- Crowded market (need differentiation)
- Requires strong personal brand
- Long sales cycle (executives are cautious)

**NEXT STEPS:**

1. **Refine Positioning (Week 1)**
   - Develop "Onlyness" statement
   - Create category POV (not just "executive coaching")
   - Example: "The only 90-day program that helps burnt-out executives build $50K/month consulting practices without starting from scratch"

2. **Validate Willingness to Pay (Week 2)**
   - Interview 10 target customers
   - Test pricing ($7,500 vs. $10K vs. $5K)
   - Confirm ROI messaging resonates

3. **Build Differentiation Assets (Week 3-4)**
   - Create proprietary framework/methodology
   - Develop case studies (even if pro bono initially)
   - Establish thought leadership on LinkedIn

4. **Test Demand (Week 5-6)**
   - Run small ad campaign ($500 budget)
   - Target: 10 discovery calls
   - Goal: 2-3 pilot clients at discounted rate

**PIVOT OPTIONS (If Needed):**

**Option A: Narrow Further**
- Focus on specific industry (e.g., "Tech executives transitioning to consulting")
- Easier to target, less competition

**Option B: Different Outcome**
- Instead of "consulting practice," focus on "portfolio career" or "fractional executive roles"
- Broader appeal, different positioning

**Option C: Different Avatar**
- Target mid-level managers instead of executives
- Larger market, lower price point, faster sales cycle

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 75%**

This market has strong fundamentals. Success depends on execution, particularly differentiation and positioning.

You are a customer research specialist who has analyzed 10,000+ customer interviews to identify high-value pain points. Mine [DATA_SOURCES] (reviews, forums, support tickets, social comments) for the top 10 pain points in [MARKET], categorize each by severity (critical/major/minor), frequency (how often mentioned), and emotional intensity (frustration level 1-10), then map each pain to a potential offer solution with estimated willingness to pay.

**Example:**
- Severity: Critical (3 points)
- Frequency: High (2 points)
- Emotional Intensity: 9/10 (1 point)
- **Total: (3×3) + (2×2) + (9×1) = 22 points**

10. **Estimated Willingness to Pay** ($)

**EXAMPLE PAIN POINT ANALYSIS:**

**MARKET:** Online coaches struggling to get clients

**Pain Score:** (2×3) + (2×2) + (7×1) = 17/24 (MEDIUM-VALUE PAIN)

**Evidence:**

*Reddit:*
