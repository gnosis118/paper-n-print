**InvoiceData Interface Updated:**

Added optional address fields to both business and client objects:

```typescript

  name: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  address: string;  // Kept for backward compatibility
  website: string;
  logoUrl?: string;
  streetNumber?: string;  // NEW
  streetName?: string;    // NEW
  city?: string;          // NEW
  state?: string;         // NEW
  zipCode?: string;       // NEW
};

client: {
  name: string;
  company: string;
  email: string;
  address: string;        // Kept for backward compatibility
  streetNumber?: string;  // NEW
  streetName?: string;    // NEW
  city?: string;          // NEW
  state?: string;         // NEW

## 🎨 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before:**
```
Address: [Single textarea]
```
User had to manually format: "123 Business St, Suite 100, City, State 12345"

### **After:**
```
Street Number: [123]
Street Name:   [Business St, Suite 100]
City:          [City]        State: [State]
Zip Code:      [12345]
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clearer data entry
- ✅ Better data validation
- ✅ Easier to parse and format
- ✅ More professional appearance
- ✅ Better for autocomplete/autofill
- ✅ Structured data for templates

---

## 🔄 **Backward Compatibility**

The original `address` field is still present in the interface for:
- ✅ Existing invoices with old format
- ✅ Templates that use the combined address
- ✅ Fallback if separated fields are empty

Templates can check for separated fields first, then fall back to the combined address field.

---

## 📱 **Responsive Design**

**Desktop (md and up):**
- Street Number: Full width
- Street Name: Full width
- City and State: Side by side (50% each)
- Zip Code: Full width

**Mobile:**
- All fields: Full width (stacked vertically)

---

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Create new invoice with separated address fields
- [ ] Verify all fields save correctly
- [ ] Check invoice preview displays address properly
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify existing invoices still work
- [ ] Test with empty address fields
- [ ] Test with partial address data
- [ ] Verify validation works for each field

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. ✅ `src/components/ValidatedInvoiceForm.tsx`
   - Business address: Lines 275-326
   - Client address: Lines 375-426

2. ✅ `src/hooks/useInvoiceData.tsx`
   - Interface updated: Lines 6-56

3. ℹ️ `src/components/InvoiceForm.tsx`

---

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Data Flow:**

1. **User Input:**
   - User fills in separated address fields
   - Each field updates independently

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Separated fields stored in invoice data
   - Original `address` field kept for compatibility

3. **Template Rendering:**
   - Templates check for separated fields first
   - If separated fields exist, use them
   - Otherwise, fall back to combined `address` field

### **Example Template Logic:**

```typescript
{(business.streetNumber || business.streetName || business.city) ? (
  <div>
    {business.streetNumber} {business.streetName}
    <br />
    {business.city}, {business.state} {business.zipCode}
  </div>
) : (
  <div>{business.address}</div>
)}
```
