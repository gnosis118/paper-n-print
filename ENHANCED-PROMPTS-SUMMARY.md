## üìä **BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON**

### **BEFORE (Original):**
```
"Define the Ideal Customer Profile for [NICHE] at [PRICE] in [REGION]. 
Create an Include vs Exclude list (5 each) and a single-sentence ICP."
```

### **AFTER (Enhanced):**
```
"You are a customer segmentation expert. Define a laser-focused Ideal
Customer Profile for [NICHE] at [PRICE] in [REGION] that maximizes LTV
while minimizing CAC.

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK:
Your ICP must balance:
- Willingness to pay (budget authority)
- Urgency of pain (buying timeline)
- Ease of reach (marketing efficiency)
- Retention potential (LTV multiplier)

INCLUDE CRITERIA (5 required):
For each, specify:
- Firmographic: Company size, revenue, industry
- Technographic: Current tools, tech stack maturity
- Behavioral: Buying patterns, decision speed
- Psychographic: Values, priorities, risk tolerance
- Situational: Trigger events, growth stage

[... continues with detailed instructions, examples, and output requirements]

Example ICP: 'Female entrepreneurs (35-50) earning $75K-$150K annually,
running service-based businesses for 2-5 years, struggling with inconsistent
revenue, active on Instagram, value community over tactics, willing to invest
$5K+ in coaching.'"
```
